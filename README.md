<!-- See demo by [this link](https://zoromari.github.io/currency-converted)  -->

#### Functionality

This is the project that helps you check the strength of your password. 
You can use letters, number and symbols for your password.

**How strength of the password is calculated:**
- Length of the password less than 8 - the password is **bad**;
- Only letters/numbers/symbols - the password is **easy**;
- Combination of letters-symbols/letters-numbers/numbers-symbols - the password is **medium**;
- Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is **strong**;

The color depends on the strength of the password and changes in real time.
